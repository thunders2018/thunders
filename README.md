ATR

any time health reports

PROBLEM STATEMENT
as every hospital/lab does not consists of 24/7 services. 
the travelling services to handover the reports might be a grand headache
patient may not be available at the assigned time to recieve the reports

SOLUTION
our app acts as a media between the patient and lab/health organisation where in the lab/health org would upload the reports in
the respective patient portal.
each patient would be having their own individual patient portal
these reports can be accessed from anywwhere and anytime 
all that they need for their acces are username and the password
